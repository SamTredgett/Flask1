# Flask1 

A short experimental project refamiliarising myself with the flask framework.
Currently in progress implementing the following:
 - Structure for logins using HTTP Requests that is secure and encrypted
 - Moving on from basic SQLAlchemy implementation to a proper login format that 
   value checks user input against the database and provides genuine authentication
