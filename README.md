# Flask1 

A short experimental project refamiliarising myself with the flask framework.
Currently in progress implementing the following:
 - Structure for logins using HTTP Requests that is secure and encrypted
 - Setting up SQL Alchemy in the project 
 - figuring out what kinda database design to use in this
